<h1>Lesson 3: Functions</h1>

A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.This is how you define a function.

<pre>
var add = function(a,b){
	return a + b;
};
</pre>
