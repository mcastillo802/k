<h1>Lesson 3: Functions</h1>
<br>
<br>
A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.These are a couple of ways you define a function:
<br>
<br>
<pre>
var add = function(a,b){
	return a + b;
};

add: function(a,b){
	return a+ b;
};
</pre>
<br>
If you were to write the function into the <code>myFunctions.js</code> tab, you could then use it in the <code>myScript.js</code> tab. Write the function into the appropirate tab and then see what happens, when you use it in the othter tab. Try out a couple of these and see what happens.
