<h1>Lesson Two: Data Types Part 1</h1>
<br>
There are serveral different data types that can be used in programming. They can be split into two different categories: Primitive and Non-Primitive (or Reference).
<br><br>
There are five different types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined. These are all just values you can assign to any variable.
<br>
To create a variable do the following:
<br>
<pre>
var myVariable = 40;
</pre>
<br>
The same process can be used to assign strings, booleans, null values, and undefined values. Do the following and see what happens:
<br><br>
<pre>
var aNumber = 40;
var aString = "Okay ";
var aVariable = aString + aNumber;
</pre>
<br>
Use <code>alert()</code> to display <code>aVariable</code> and see what happens. If you do not remember how to use <code>alert()</code> feel free to look back at lesson one.
<br>
As you have probably seen by now the result is probabaly not what you expected. This is a result of concatination or when the program combines two strings. This will happen anytime you use "+" to combine a string and a number/string.
