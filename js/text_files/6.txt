<h1>Lesson Five: Functions and Return Values</h1>
<br>
<br>
As seen in ther previous lesson, functions can be put into methods as arguments. The reason for this is very simple, return values. Return values allow the function to be assigned a value which can then be used as an argument in a method. It is not necessary for a function to have a return value, but it is very helpful sometimes.
<br>
<br>
For example, look at the following lines of code and try to figure out what would happen before testing it. Don't forget to put the add function into the "myFunctions.js" tab, if you have not done this already.
<br>
<br>
<pre>
rameses.moveUp(add(1,1));
rameses.moveDown(add(add(1,1),add(2,2)));
rameses.alert("OMG, it's " +add(4,5));
</pre>
<br>
<br>
If you guessed <code>rameses</code> would move up 2, down 6, and then say it's 9, then you are correct. As you may have noticed, it is also possible to use the same function as an argument for itself. This is possible becuase the innermost functions will always run first in this situation and return values that can be used for the outermost function.
