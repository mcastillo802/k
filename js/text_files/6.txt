<h1>Lesson Five: Functions and Parameters</h1>
<br>
<br>
As seen in ther previous lesson, functions can be put into methods as arguments. The reason for this is very simple, return values. Return values allow the function to be assigned a value which can then be used as an argument in a method.
<br>
<br>
For example, look at the following lines of code and try to figure out what would happen before testing it.
<br>
<br>
<pre>
rameses.moveUp(add(1,1);
rameses.moveDown(add(add(1,1),add(2,2)));
rameses.alert("OMG, it's " +add(4,5));
</pre>
<br>
<br>
If you guessed <code>rameses</code> would move up 2, down 6, and then say it's 9, then you are correct.
