<h1>Lesson Four: Loops and Rameses</h1>
<br>
For loops and while loops are two ways that you can get a repeating action to occcur in JavaScript.
The main differences are the ways that they end. For loops end after a specific amount of repetitions and while loops end when a certain condition is met.
<br>
<br>
You can check out the differences using these bits of codes:
<br><br>
<pre>
for(var i=1;i<6;i++){
rameses.alert("I have done this "+i+" times");
}

var i = 1;
while(i < 6){
rameses.alert("This is the "+i+" iteration");
i++;
}
</pre>
